# Daily Weather Data Analysis
Daily Weather Data
        This project provides a comprehensive analysis of daily weather data, including temperature, precipitation, and other relevant meteorological information. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we explore, visualize, and derive insights from the weather dataset. This project is particularly useful for those interested in understanding weather patterns and trends.

# How to Use the Code
  To use this project, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it via Anaconda or pip.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file weather.ipynb.
- Ensure the dataset file weather-data.csv is in the same directory as the notebook.
- Run the cells in the notebook to execute the analysis.

# Key Features
- Data Exploration: Initial inspection and cleaning of the dataset.
- Visualization: Graphical representation of weather trends using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Statistical Analysis: Summary statistics and correlation analysis to understand relationships between different weather parameters.
- Prediction: Basic forecasting models to predict future weather patterns based on historical data.
